/*
In this lesson, we're going to explore the different types of variables or properties in javascript.

Properties can be loosely grouped into two categories, primitives and objects.

In javascript, there are 5 primitive types.  These are as follows:
* undefined
* null (sort of a primitive type)
* boolean
* string
* number

Everything else is an object.  Common objects in javascript include the following:
* object literals, i.e. declarations in brackets 
* arrays
* functions


Let's look into this a little more.  For each of the primitive variables listed below, create a corresponding new camelcased variable prefixed with `typeOf` that contains property type.  (Hint: you can use the typeOf operator to get the type of variable)

var a = "abcdef",
b = 8057,
c = false,
d = undefined,
e = null;

//Provide your answers below
var typeOfA = /* your answer */;
var typeOfB = /* your answer */;
var typeOfC = /* your answer */;
var typeOfD = /* your answer */;
var typeOfE = /* your answer */;


console.log("Type for variable A: " + typeOfA);
console.log("Type for variable B: " + typeOfB);
console.log("Type for variable C: " + typeOfC);
console.log("Type for variable D: " + typeOfD);
console.log("Type for variable E: " + typeOfE);
